ldesc: "Cppo is an equivalent of the C preprocessor targeted at the 
OCaml language and its variants. The main purpose of cppo is to provide 
a lightweight tool for simple macro substitution (#define) and file 
inclusion (#include) for the occasional case when this is useful in 
OCaml. Processing specific sections of files by calling external 
programs is also possible via #ext directives."
